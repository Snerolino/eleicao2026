**Learning:** In lists filtering logic where multiple fields are checked (like in `HomePage.tsx`), calling expensive string normalizations upfront on all fields causes a massive slowdown (e.g. 15x slower).
**Action:** Order checks from cheapest (e.g., party string matching, number string matching) to most expensive (e.g., unicode string normalization), using short-circuit evaluation (returning early) to skip the expensive checks whenever possible. Also memoize derived properties computations across lists when they re-render.
## 2024-05-19 - [Deferred Search Input]
**Learning:** Using `useDeferredValue` for a search query that filters a large list (`filterCandidates` on all candidates) improves typing responsiveness. Crucially, any downstream grouping or mapping logic that depends on the filtered results should be wrapped in `useMemo` so it doesn't unnecessarily re-compute on every single keystroke.
**Action:** When filtering complex lists, wrap the query passed to the filter function with `useDeferredValue` and use `useMemo` for any derived computations based on the filtered output. Ensure UI elements showing counts sync with the deferred query to prevent visual mismatches.
## 2024-05-19 - [Reference Stability in Custom Hooks]
**Learning:** Returning dynamically instantiated objects or `Set`s from a custom hook without wrapping them in `useMemo` breaks reference equality across re-renders. For example, returning `new Set(savedIds)` triggers downstream components to unnecessarily re-evaluate and re-render.
**Action:** Always wrap derived reference types (like arrays, objects, and Sets) in `useMemo` within custom hooks before returning them, ensuring reference stability.
