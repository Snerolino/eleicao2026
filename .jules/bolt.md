## 2023-10-27 - [Short-circuit eval in filter]
**Learning:** In lists filtering logic where multiple fields are checked (like in `HomePage.tsx`), calling expensive string normalizations upfront on all fields causes a massive slowdown (e.g. 15x slower).
**Action:** Order checks from cheapest (e.g., party string matching, number string matching) to most expensive (e.g., unicode string normalization), using short-circuit evaluation (returning early) to skip the expensive checks whenever possible. Also memoize derived properties computations across lists when they re-render.
